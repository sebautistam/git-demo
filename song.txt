Hello, it's RAYE here
Please, get nice and comfortable and lock your phones
Because the story is about to begin (uh)

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna tell you 'bout
One of the many men, name is irrelevant, height is irrelevant
He was a one out of a ten, I wish that I knew it then
I'm still recovering

Truly, I'm vulnerable, I love a sentiment
Quickly I opened up, I learned my lesson then
Thought I was safe again, thought he was innocent
I was so wrong

I can't deny
I was stuck in the daze, terrible phase
You was convincing, though
Very believable, the role that you played

So I'll take this front row seat
And, baby, baby, you can go ahead
Cry those Oscar-winning tears
Popcorn and I scream
Baby, baby, you can go ahead
Cry those Oscar-winning tears, baby, hmm
